# Equality

Plain and simple, Dave supports full equality for all citizens, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) citizens. The federal government needs to act to protect all citizens equally.

- Direct the federal government to recognize and provide full benefits for lawful same-sex marriages, and ensure those benefits are available in all states
- Extend federal non-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity
- Include bullying and harrassment prevention in federal programs that support school safety
