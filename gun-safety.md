# Gun Safety: Common sense for our cities and schools

Our Constitution provides the foundation for America's gun laws -- we must build on that foundation to ensure our schools are safe and that guns don't end up in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.

South Jersey residents have been victims of some of the largest gun violence tragedies in recent years. Despite new measures designed to make our schools safer in the event of an attacker with a gun, our leaders must do more to stop the flow of illegal guns -- starting with requiring background checks on all guns, whether they be sold through private sellers, at gun shows, or online.

## Fresh Start for Safety

We need common sense reforms that strengthen our background check system and support our communities' local efforts to prevent gun violence: 

- Require background checks for all gun sales, closing loopholes that allow criminals and those found mentally unsound — like the shooter at Virginia Tech — to purchase firearms
- End the sale of high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons
- Work with our South Jersey medical communities to study and curb the public health impacts of gun violence, then take those proposals to Washington and play a leading role in enacting the findings at a national level
- Increase funding for school safety programs and counseling services for those affected by gun violence
