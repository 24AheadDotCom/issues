# Immigration: A Fresh Take

At first my position on immigration was similar to that of top Democratic and Republican politicians.

Then, I took a closer look at the issue. I asked myself why major corporations and other powerful forces want massive immigration and immigration reform so much. What do they hope to gain?

What do big box retailers, major fast food companies, major growers, major food processors, the US Chamber of Commerce, and all the rest hope to gain from massive immigration and immigration reform?

Those major corporations aren't in the habit of doing things that **raise** wages, are they?

I soon realized that those major corporations - and the other powerful interests spending millions of dollars per year pushing for more immigration and for immigration reform - all have their own interests in mind. Some want to gain money, some want to gain power, but they're all in it for themselves.

I'm in it for you, the residents of my district. I'm going to put your interests first, not the interests of far-away multinational corporations.

## My Plan

- Oppose illegal immigration. No, really: I won't just say I'll oppose it and then take steps to make the situation worse. I'll actually oppose it.
- Support attrition. Under that plan we'd increase immigration enforcement and decrease benefits that illegal aliens can receive with the goal of encouraging them to return home.
- Have a frank conversation with sending countries. Foreign countries need to provide for their own people, not encourage them to come to the U.S. illegally.
- Support an iron-clad repatriation program for "DREAMers". Those who were brought here illegally deserve the highest education they're qualified for. However, the DREAM Act would have a negative impact on American students. It would also braindrain foreign countries that need all the smart people they can keep. I'll encourage DREAMers to go home and get educations in their own countries, with assistance from the U.S. government if necessary.

## How I'll Do That

That sounds good, but without an action plan to make it happen it's worthless. In order to make it happen I'll challenge those powerful forces that support massive immigration and immigration reform and show how their plans will harm both the U.S. and other countries. There's a lot of money behind massive immigration and immigration reform and they're more than willing to lie and smear. I'll respond by exposing their lies and showing how their policies will harm the U.S.
