# Modernizing Our Government

As a Senior Technology Advisor at the White House, Dave saw first hand both the challenges and opportunities for modernizing the way government works. There are key areas where Congress can drastically improve the ability of government agencies to better serve citizens:

- Reinstate the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to provide expert guidance to lawmakers on technology systems and policy
- Reform the procurement rules that govern purchasing new technology systems to encourage competition, internal development, and bringing in small businesses and highly skilled workers
- Revise legislation like the Paperwork Reduction Act that governs the use of technology but that has not been updated to account for the radical shifts in information technology brought about by the internet
- End the backlog of VA benefits claims that has veterans waiting over 250 days to receive benefits by providing resources to streamline the claims process
