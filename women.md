# Women: Economic Fairness and Quality Health Care 

## Ending Pay Discrimination

Women deserve equal pay for equal work. In 2014, there's just no excuse for women being treated differently than men in our economy. But that's exactly what's happening, where across the country, women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Our campaign supports legislation that would close the gap of women being paid less than men for doing the same work.

## Supporting Women's Health

Women should have fair and affordable access to quality health care. The new reforms for health care finally ban insurance companies from charging women higher premiums, and it prevents insurance companies from discriminating against women, such as by limiting coverage for women who are pregnant or victims of domestic abuse.

Women should also have access to full health care options, including contraception and maternity care, which some in Congress have sought to restrict to score political points.

Dave supports women's reproductive rights. Decisions about terminating pregnancy are deeply personal. A woman's health, the circumstances of the pregnancy, and any number of issues may impact her decision, but ultimately it is her decision to make. The government should not stand between a woman, her doctor, her family, her religious leaders, or any of those with whom she chooses to confide.
