# Protecting Social Security and Medicare

Our campaign opposes any efforts to cut or privatize Social Security or Medicare benefits, including raising the retirement age or cutting cost of living adjustments. These programs provide vital support for our seniors and those living with disabilities, and we must protect them and ensure we continue to keep the promise we've made to retiring workers.

We can do more to strengthen Medicare by restoring its ability to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving taxpayers at least $137 billion over the next ten years.
