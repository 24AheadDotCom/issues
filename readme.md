# Issues

Issues should be at the heart of any political campaign. These are my positions on the key issues facing our district and our country. They're available hear in an open-source format so anyone can suggest improvements or additions. On my website, http://coleforcongress.com/issues, you can also make a contribution to support a particular position, or submit comments on them.

This website is a simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). Developers are free to use this website for other candidate or issue campaigns as desired, however the real value is in the content, not the code.

All position statements are in [markdown files](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics). These are simple text files, and are easy to edit.
